# Overview

This app is called Mercatus a simple mobile app that displays a slider base image for a mobile e commerce app. I lists categories as well as products to the user and when the product is clicked it displays the product details on the screen as a modal. Products can be added and filtered by categories to display.
The user can also add images taken by the device camera as well as get their geolocation coordinates. These device features are meant for admin management but are not fully developed yet as it is a work in progress.

## Usage
Git clone the repo into your local machine, ensuring you have java 17 installed as well as android studio installed and setup.

Click on the build play button the build will run for some minutes and then install the app on an android connected externally or the emulator in the android studio from whence the app can be used.
